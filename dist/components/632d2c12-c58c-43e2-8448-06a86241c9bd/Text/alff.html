        <p>Meggy snaps open her eyes, a child&rsquo;s eyes, onto a child&rsquo;s room. Onto her nine fingers, the alarm clock; the dilapidated tectonic plates. She showers. She brushes her teeth and pulls a sweater and jeans over her pajamas. She takes two stairs at a time, every two steps a stumble. She reaches for the fridge door, the granola, the key to the lock, pulls down her visor and takes off. Racing by her: lawns, semi-detached houses, parents and parents of parents. At the school entrance, she hears a badly parked scooter tip over behind her but carries on walking. In the math exam, she picks the right answers. Someone jams her in a locker. Someone slams the books out of her hands. Someone kicks the glasses off her face.</p>

        <p>Behind the corridors, behind the swing door and the bike racks, behind the schoolyard, behind the baseball field, there hangs the body of a lifeless boy. His skin has been sewn fastidiously into the fence&rsquo;s boring symmetrical grid. Once the police have photographed the scene thoroughly, they peel the corpse from the mesh with a carpet knife. The blade breaks at his right elbow as well as at his right heel. Slowly he slides into the undertaker&rsquo;s arms, into the narrow coffin, into the belly of the cemetery. Nearly everyone from the High &amp; Low High School has come to the funeral &mdash; teachers, students, caretaking staff, the lifeguard for the outdoor pool. Benjamin's parents stand there, in front of them the graveless rectangle and above them an immaterial sun. His father wearing that skinny tie and his mother a necklace made from orange beads. She says,</p>
        <p>&ndash;He was never quiet and he was never loud.</p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s an autumn, in the year 1994. Ice cream sales are down. Homecoming weekend. Meggy&rsquo;s face is pretty. Meggy&rsquo;s face would be pretty if it weren&rsquo;t for that birthmark under her right eye. Her face is a mess. Or totally exquisite. It depends. Her left eye is green, her right eye is blue. Her nose is delicate; her fingertips are delicate, as if they were carved from wood, made from old wooden spoons like those grandma used to drag through the spinach. On her left hand the ring finger is missing. She wears layers of silk, cashmere, and knitwear, muted colors, and suede shoes. She was never quiet, never loud, never foolish. What she disliked about last summer wasn&rsquo;t the absence of beauty, but the loss of that kind of cheerfulness that makes doing nothing peaceful and relaxing. A parasitic notion of self-reinvention and rediscovery took hold of her thoughts.</p>

        <p>Benjamin wakes up, looks at his alarm clock and swears. He swears in every way he can think of &mdash; he swears at life, time, the sky, and the animals in the forest. Why didn&rsquo;t his Mom wake him up, as she does every morning? He finds none of his forebears in the bedroom and none in the living room. Maybe in the kitchen? No, not in the kitchen either. Benjamin cuts two slices of homemade bread, toasts them, garnishes them with sweet potato strips, sprouts, brie, pear slices, mayonnaise, and a leaf of leaf lettuce. It tastes good. He washes it down with orange juice and decaffeinated drip coffee. The word <i>decaf</i> makes him think of <i>air force</i>, because the f sticks out at the end like the wing of a fighter jet. If Benjamin were to find a genie in the coffee jar, one who carried out every command it was given regardless of its nature, he would issue the order to bomb Belgium. He thinks the Belgians got off too easily for their crimes when they had their colonies and afterwards. Justice. To pay back his mother for not waking him up at the usual time, he&rsquo;s not going to clean up the kitchen. If he had known that the open jar of mayonnaise he left there would, for the rest of his mother&rsquo;s life, be a symbol of the arbitrariness of God &mdash; or, rather, his non-existence &mdash; he would have picked something more interesting. Or something less complex. He gets on his bike, rides to school, French-kisses Nataly under the bleachers, puts up with a joke about his freckles, rocks back and forth in his chair, chews gum and falls down. Why am I not on the baseball team? Why does Nataly have such small breasts? What does the immortality of the soul actually mean? Strangely, Benjamin asks himself just two of these three questions that day, though only one of them is truly compelling. The following day, shortly before noon, three boys are out in the woods smoking their first cigarette and find him. Nataly places the palm of her hand on his cheek, which bears a striking resemblance to the Milky Way. She says,</p>
        <p>&ndash;See you soon.</p>
        <p>and</p>
        <p>&ndash;Maybe your t-shirt is too small after all.</p>
        <p>or she says,</p>
        <p>&ndash;I wish you were an antelope, standing alone in the steppe, and then a wild lioness comes and rips you apart. I would be the wildlife photographer.</p>
        <p>But most of all she says,</p>
        <p>&ndash;See you soon.</p>
        <p>Fourteen months later, a dog will find a scrap of his clothing outside an entirely different city in an entirely different state.</p>

        <p>People who have so far gone unmentioned: the angry ginger with the pockmarks, the girl with one eye.</p>

        <p>The day after Benjamin&rsquo;s naked corpse is discovered on the fence, Nataly and Meggy meet in the girls&rsquo; toilet. They stand next to each other at separate sinks, but there&rsquo;s a single mirror reflecting their faces back.</p>
        <p>&ndash;I&rsquo;m sorry about the thing with -</p>
        <p>&ndash;Yes?</p>
        <p>&ndash;Yes.</p>
        <p>Nataly shows her the hickey on her neck.</p>
        <p>&ndash;You know where I got that?</p>
        <p>&ndash;Is it &ndash;</p>
        <p>&ndash;It&rsquo;s the only thing that&rsquo;s keeping Benjamin in this world. When the hickey is gone, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
        <p>Her eyes thick with tears, Nataly rummages in her handbag. It is full of notes and pens and hair clips and a nail file. She plunges the sharp cosmetic utensil into the spot where Benjamin&rsquo;s lips had been so hot yesterday. Nataly faints. Meggy is engulfed by the splutter of blood and faints. Susie, Susie, and Susanne enter the bathroom. Seeing the puddle of blood, they faint. Fortunately, though, Susie tumbles into the doorway in such a way that a young voyeur is offered a glimpse up her skirt. He faints immediately. A few minutes pass in which nothing happens except that Nataly loses more blood. Meggy comes to. She pulls the nail file out of Nataly&rsquo;s neck and stops the wound with her thumb. This is how they drive to the hospital, and Nataly survives the escapade, even if for a while she is put on suicide watch.</p>

        <p>School closes for a few days, and Meggy wonders how she will live from now on. She has a soft spot for radio shows, national anthems, and short books. She loves going to the movies because there you can stare into the sun without going blind. Here&rsquo;s what she doesn&rsquo;t have: a functional family unit, a horse, a functional hair band, a pony tail, cocks.</p>

        <p>The members of the Party Party Club are in shock. How are they supposed to organize a decent Homecoming so soon after the execution of one of their schoolmates? And what about all the slogans they had come up with? <span style= "font-variant:small-caps">murderous means: so mean, we&rsquo;re hung up on vice</span>, or <span style= "font-variant:small-caps">hopefully benjamin will die soon</span>: all these were now out of the question. They would seem ironic now, even insufficiently pious.</p>

        <p>Meggy is thinking and thinking, and she notices something. She wants to do good and to help people. She wants to be the kind of girl that isn&rsquo;t accused of lacking any purpose in the world. But the police won&rsquo;t hire her anytime soon, so she decides on a career change to private detective. She launches her own investigation into the case of Benjamin MacNash at the crime scene by the fence. An icy wind blows against her eyelashes. The streets are gray, the cosmos is cheerless. A clue, she thinks, there must be a clue. She pats down the grass and mashes a bug between her fingers, sniffs them. She jots down: <i>The murderer must have been tall and strong, technically skilled, perhaps with a penchant for sewing or knitting. He or she must lack any scruple, but be in possession of a scalpel and perhaps a serial offender.</i> But raindrops make the ink run. Who does that kind of thing, anyway? I mean, who even has extreme emotions like hate, love or lust? Finally, she finds something substantial, a clue. She cannot understand how the police could have overlooked it, but at least it corroborates her low opinion of them.</p>

        <p>While Nataly&rsquo;s in the hospital, Meggy and her seem to start to become friends.</p>

        <p>&ndash;Enemies? I don&rsquo;t know if he had enemies. Not really, why would someone have had something against him? He was a normal guy, he got along with the jocks, the math geeks, his teachers, people of all persuasions. His parents were good-looking, caring, and thoughtful, and I loved him.</p>
        <p>&ndash;Jealousy?</p>
        <p>&ndash;No.</p>
        <p>&ndash;Still, I would like to come over to yours for dinner sometime.</p>
        <p>&ndash;Of course.</p>
        <p>&ndash;I&rsquo;ll give you a call. Most definitely I&rsquo;ll call you. Like, sometime in the early evening?</p>
        <p>&ndash;Sure.</p>

        <p>The asymmetry frightens Nataly. Meggy&rsquo;s face reminds her of something or some thing.</p>

        <p>The guts of November, they are cold. Meggy gets an A on her math exam. She is the best. Mr Cello praises her. After class, they jam her in a locker, knock the books out of her hands, and kick the glasses off her face. The roar of an airplane engine starting up rings in her ears. She&rsquo;s afraid that she&rsquo;ll explode, alone, helpless in the dark. She screams and screams.</p>

        <p>Nataly has signed up for the ski trip, but she feels uncomfortable because people see her as fucked by death and she&rsquo;s an outsider. This annoys her tremendously.</p>

        <p>Home-o-ween. The good town is still in mourning, so the Party Party Club has decided not to throw a party after all, and instead to put on a warehouse party in an old machine plant that used to be a butcher shop and before that, a crematorium &mdash; because after all it&rsquo;s Halloween and people eat pumpkins. Nataly, Miranda, and the two boys Joseph and Lenny are in a car weaving through the streets, hoping to throw rotten eggs at buildings and smash letterboxes with baseball bats. Nataly met Miranda on the ski trip and at least one of their tensed calves touched the other&rsquo;s. The idea of falling in love ever again with another boy, one who&rsquo;s a boy differently from how Benjamin was one, seemed repulsive to her and wrong, and so, to finally get back at God, she is now trespassing in female flowers. But because social exclusion hangs around near same-sex love, they both pretend to be on a date, driving around in a group of four. Often they don&rsquo;t talk much, but at least there's good music playing.</p>

        <p>&ndash;So, at the party&hellip;</p>
        <p>&ndash;At what party?</p>
        <p>&ndash;Haven&rsquo;t you kittens heard?</p>
        <p>&ndash;Kittens?</p>
        <p>&ndash;Well, you&rsquo;re some perky little kittens, aren&rsquo;t you?</p>
        <p>The things one has to put up with.</p>

        <p>Meggy lies in the tree-lined street. She stares at the sky, which is being eaten away by treetops, left and right, above and below. Things drizzle down on her &mdash; leaves, leaflets, tree trash. The color spectrum is like that of an autopsy. She lies on the asphalt and drinks rye. She tosses a black stone in the air and catches it in her mouth. She tries to chew on it, but it&rsquo;s too hard. She sucks on it, plays with the stone with her tongue, wants to find a place for it somewhere, somewhere between the lines, but can&rsquo;t. She realizes that the universe is not in equilibrium, and that, of all metaphors, the missing piece to the puzzle is to be avoided most of all. She realizes that there are only knives that cut into everything and stomachs that digest. She bites down again and again on the stone until her whole mouth is full of blood and splintered teeth, and she pours some rye into the mix and it burns and in a ball of pain she swallows everything &mdash; the tooth fragments, the blood, the whiskey, and the stone.</p>

        <p>A four-four beat repeats itself once more. Nataly, her secret lover Miranda, and the two boys Joseph and Lenny stand in a corner that&rsquo;s far too big for them, holding their strawberry punches tight. In order to get a picture of what they look like standing there, surrounded by dancers and disco balls, you have to picture them from far away. With a microwavelike emptiness in their heads and lives and splashes of tomato sauce on the inside of their eyes. Everything is different, until everything is the same again. While Nataly dances, while she talks about the pills that are there called XTC, the pills that the boys got from somewhere or other, speeched off someone, fobbed off someone, while she takes a swig of her drink, while Miranda tries to get her hand in underneath her buttcrack, during all of this, Nataly asks herself if it&rsquo;s always like that with the dead. Do they always stay behind in the past, or is there a way of getting them to come along? Are they watching? She remembers when she was on Hawaii with her parents once, she and her sister pushing puberty, with just a few nights to go &mdash; it was an untroubled, glorious time. Leaning on the counter at a beachside bar, an old man explained voodoo to her. Camera flashes, fog, cigarette weather. Were those all dead people who got forgotten in the present? Later Nataly and Miranda sit in the back seat of a car. They couldn&rsquo;t give a shit about the morning sun. They are looking for protection and warmth. They don&rsquo;t touch, they just talk to each other about which crime novels are worth a read and Nataly secretly asks herself whether its a gift from the universe that she&rsquo;s so damn good at making other people happy.</p>

        <p>Benjamin&rsquo;s murderer is nicknamed the &ldquo;fencecutioner&rdquo; when the school newspaper writes about him.</p>

        <p>&ndash;Why do they assume a him and not a her?</p>
        <p>nobody asks.</p>

        <p>Nataly didn&rsquo;t do it. Meggy knows that. Sure, Nataly can be violent, she&rsquo;s a member of the knitting and embroidery club, and emotionally reckless as well, but she&rsquo;s really not the type. And in general Meggy thinks it&rsquo;s unlikely that it was someone from school. The type of murder, the blow of the hammer to the skull, the delight in cracking bones, and the finicky presentation of one&rsquo;s own work&mdash;that doesn&rsquo;t seem like something a student from the High &amp; Low High School would do. All her acquaintances are far too lazy to go to that kind of trouble.</p>

        <p>Miranda nods off, Nataly inspects her. Miranda&rsquo;s chest moves up and down, the air in her lungs is warm. Her skin, that skimpy rag that stops her from leaking, is soft. One could wipe spectacle lenses with her skin. Nataly runs her fingers over Miranda's lips, takes the bottom lip, grasps it between her thumb and middle finger. Pulls. And spits into the small vessel between mouth and teeth. Their faces are very close. She reaches deep into the left pocket of her pants and into the right and falls asleep.</p>

        <p>The day he turned fourteen, Benjamin and Nataly had been together for two years. So she gave him a special present, because they were sure they were made for each other and for ever and ever. It was the ring she found in the woods. It was made of wood and gold. To return the generosity, on her fifteenth birthday Nataly got a ring as well. Benjamin had made it from the wiring of his beloved tube TV set. They were in love and they were serious and it was good. When it became clear that Benjamin was a deceased young man, Nataly cut the ring off her ring finger and the ring finger off her hand.</p>

        <p>One day, when spring is already around the corner, Nataly and Meggy meet outside on the field. Winter never came and the ground is soft, though the light is still frozen. Each of them puts forward their scarred left hand. Their finger stubs interlock like cogs of an antique machine.</p>

        <p>&ndash;Did you hear? They&rsquo;re saying that an older couple living in a hut in the woods took the life of your lover.</p>
        <p>&ndash;I know.</p>
        <p>&ndash;They&rsquo;re being executed tomorrow.</p>
        <p>&ndash;I know.</p>
        <p>&ndash;But they didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
        <p>&ndash;I know.</p>
        <p>&ndash;Funny.</p>
        <p>says Meggy.</p>
        <p>&ndash;Not so important. We&rsquo;ve got to get out of here. We&rsquo;ve got to get out, get out of everything.</p>
        <p>But nothing can grow where a wish used to be.</p>

        <p>The stadium is on the edge of the town, which borders a forest and a small mountain. The latter is the only elevation for dozens of miles, with the exception of the church steeple. It&rsquo;s a flat little town altogether. Although its houses may have three stories they have such low ceilings that they would count as two-story houses in other eastern US towns. What the town has instead are streets so wide that the wind hardly whistles. Everything is gray-green or white or red &mdash; except the telephone poles, which are remarkably black for their age. Even the cables have lost none of their blackness; they still map out the symphony of telecommunications installed in the early &rsquo;60s, when everything was redone around here: the houses, the streets, the sky. The church isn&rsquo;t smack in the center of town, it never was. If you were to compare the town to a dartboard, seen from above, you&rsquo;d find the church on triple 19. The church steeple is there and you can see it from all over, and for anyone that way inclined it is a wagging index finger, protruding up towards the sky. Of course it&rsquo;s ridiculously short and nowhere near scraping the sky, but it&rsquo;s still higher than everything else, and cold and severe. Its severity, though, comes up short at its own fa&ccedil;ade, since the steeple clocks, projecting the time of day in all four directions of the compass, are each wrong in a different inexplicable way. Rumor has it that the clock on the north face is right three times a day, you just have to keep checking it. So, that&rsquo;s the church. Thanks to a local campaign, an exception was made and the execution will be carried out in the stadium. Meggy and Nataly go there together. Wood shavings are strewn everywhere and security people line the arena, holding buckets and blankets. The couple from the hut in the woods are led shrieking and begging into the center, into the area visible from the sold-out bleachers. The security people throw the blankets over the condemned couple and then beat them to death with the buckets. The whole thing takes 47 minutes and ice cream sales are not as good as expected, but the peanut-vendors make a tidy sum.</p>

        <p>After the spectacle&rsquo;s over, Meggy and Nataly saunter together through the center of town, a place of emptiness, dusty store fronts, and street lights. There used to be a fish vendor here and a cheese store, there were specialist shops for shoe inserts, lottery tickets, and pistachio ice cream. There were bars and cafes, truly one-of-a-kind, and islands of expertise on subjects such as pumpkins. A lady owned a whole store here that sold nothing but pumpkins &mdash; pumpkins in the shape of snails, vials and cauliflowers &mdash; but it is not open today. Everything in the city center has closed down except for the diner, so for all other essentials the residents of the town have to scavenge in basements and catacombs, in the stretch of the sewage system where Darkmart opened in the summer of '92. Quietly, the owner chiseled shelves into the underground, and from there on, bit by bit, he supplanted all economic life in the city. Sometimes, during the short hours in the night when Darkmart is closed, steam comes up to the streets through the storm drains, mingling with the stench of burned rock, and you can hear the store shelves adjusting their position quietly beneath the ground, a monstrous serpent of tupperware, preserved meat and gallons of milk, its hot breath. Nataly talks about Miranda a lot, about the fact that her parents and sister aren&rsquo;t allowed to know about their forbidden love, although it is so beautiful, and about how the way that the love of one lover can be so different from that of another. They sit in the diner, and are served by a grouchy sailor.</p>

        <p>&ndash;What&rsquo;ll it be? Are you bunnies up for some lettuce?</p>
        <p>&ndash;No.</p>
        <p>&ndash;Two large Cokes, zucchini burgers, and fries.</p>

        <p>From her bag, Meggy pulls the evidence that she found and then forgot and then found again and forgot again and found again and then forgot again and then saw by coincidence on the desk and then misplaced somewhere and then worked back up through memory, in order to show it to Nataly. That thing from the crime scene. Neither of them knows what to make of it.</p>

        <p>&ndash;So.</p>
        <p>&ndash;It appears to be a kind of geometric nebula.</p>
        <p>&ndash;Or, more like, a piece of silverware.</p>
        <p>&ndash;Maybe a key?</p>
        <p>&ndash;Or a crank?</p>
        <p>&ndash;A motor, then?</p>
        <p>&ndash;Or a tool?</p>
        <p>&ndash;Maybe it&rsquo;s an artist&rsquo;s tool?</p>
        <p>&ndash;Or art?</p>
        <p>&ndash;Maybe it&rsquo;s just... stuff?</p>

        <p>They disagree. The food arrives and Nataly doesn&rsquo;t feel like playing the guessing game anymore, she secretly thinks that the girl sitting across from her despises her. Meggy is asymmetric, idiosyncratic, borderline uninteresting, and also she doesn&rsquo;t take care of her appearance. Nataly knows that beautiful people are often exciting and charismatic, clever and quick, while less beautiful people tend to be more banal. But then who could help her &mdash; Meggy, that is &mdash; identify the piece of evidence? That would probably be more likely Bobby, King of Boyland.</p>
        <p>&ndash;Oh? And who&rsquo;s that? And how can I meet him?</p>
        <p>&ndash;I know somebody.</p>

        <p>says Nataly. Fear, happiness, fear and happiness. Because they like the sailor they tip him a lot. Meggy sticks around for a bit and takes a few notes.</p>

        <p>Medium-sized birds are singing and Nataly is walking among the town&rsquo;s low-rise buildings and loses herself in thought. Sticks, stones, and bottle caps pierce through the worn soles of her sneakers. She chews her hair. Then she chews the knot of her friendship bracelet, her fingernails, fingers, and hand. Eventually she crouches down and chews her knee. What if Meggy wants to meet up again? What if she wants to be my girlfriend? What if no one ever solves this murder? How much more time am I going to spend with this person? What excuses will she find to call me again? To hassle me with her presence? Nataly bites down. With her front teeth, she has gouged out a small hole in her knee, which she now laboriously tears open further. She lies on the ground in the middle of the sidewalk, and dreamily licks her exposed kneecap. Later, much later, when she&rsquo;s finally fallen asleep, Joseph and Lenny drop by on their red scooters and abduct her. They bring her home and Joseph cradles her in his arms and carries her and has got past the door, past her mother and father, into her room and tucks her in. He strips off his jersey, his shirt, and lies down beside her, folding his arms into a pillow. He offers her a cigarette, she shakes her head. He offers her his tongue, she shakes her head. On his chest, a small Jesus gleams on a small cross.</p>
        <p>&ndash;Do you believe in God?</p>
        <p>He takes off Nataly&rsquo;s skirt, kisses her feet, her shins, her thighs, her hips, the fabric of her underpants, which is lukewarm, and she shrieks, curses and spits; it doesn&rsquo;t stop. She makes her fingers into a fist and punches him in the neck. Her sister, who&rsquo;s been watching all along, grabs a marker pen and rams it into Joseph&rsquo;s ribs. He doesn&rsquo;t fight back. Delicate rips appear on his skin. The scent of lust mingles with the stench of fear.</p>

        <p>There are strict rules at the High &amp; Low School, for example concerning who is allowed to eat what where and when in the cafeteria, and for how long. Of course not everyone gets to have a meal without meat. Some students spend entire semesters eating ground meat, goulash, schnitzels, goulash, or goulash. Rules of this kind govern other daily routines &ndash; all of them in fact. Students who follow them are essentially choosing ritual humiliation over the cruelty of improvisation, which can be a good deal more scary. Privileges come to those students who are older, more beautiful, or wealthier. Meggy has got a problem with these structures. She simply doesn&rsquo;t recognize them, so she cannot respect them, contextualize them, or reproduce them. Maybe this is because her whole life plays out exclusively in the present. Maybe it&rsquo;s because of calcium deficiency. Maybe this problem, which is her great problem with life and with the world, is in a strange and special way the great advantage she has over them.</p>

        <p>While Nataly stares at the ceiling of her bedroom, ignoring whatever her sister is saying, the phone rings and she tunes out her surroundings. She has no idea where Joseph is, not even if he was actually ever there at all. She shifts her gaze from the ceiling to the wall. Benjamin had once given her Slayer&rsquo;s <i>Reign in Blood</i> and called her his little Angel of Death. This prompted her to buy a Slayer poster and hang it on her wall. Miranda made a mix tape with her favorite songs; she wonders if she should now hang up a poster of Miranda or of one of the singers from her favorite bands. Nataly&rsquo;s father Henry, her mother Amy, and her sister Emily lie down in her bed, one after the other. Amy asks why Nataly didn&rsquo;t answer the phone. Didn&rsquo;t she know who was calling? No, she didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
        <p>&ndash;How should I have known? Who was it?</p>
        <p>No one picked up the telephone.</p>
        <p>&ndash;Shall we eat dinner?</p>
        <p>But they don&rsquo;t feel like it and stay in bed. They wonder who might have called at this hour. Their relatives from Zurich? The defilers? The caretaker with the wooden eyes? Those who died in battle? They lie there watching the lives they didn&rsquo;t have slip by, the days spent in the park, the quiet hours, and the hands, above all the hands, which would have stroked their upper arms and drawn treasure maps on their backs. How they would have stood at the train station; how a sudden switch from tenderness to lust would have made them tense their muscles &mdash; to hold the other, throw caution to the wind, and gobble them up.</p>

        <p>Lenny is skinnier than Joseph. You can see the ribs and wrist bones under his skin. He has thick short black hair and wears metal-rimmed glasses, their right edge patched up with yeast and baking parchment. He owns many vinyl records and a record player and also a red scooter. At night, when his dad is asleep, he goes over to the liquor shelf and the bookshelf. He selects the most beautiful items from each and drives down the tree-lined streets on his red scooter. At every spot that reminds him of Joseph he stops to read a chapter and take a swig. By the time he realizes that it was once the done thing for Russian writers to write very short chapters and that today it&rsquo;s the done thing for Scottish distilleries to manufacture very strong liquor, it&rsquo;s too late. He is incredibly drunk. He drives into a fence and into a ditch, loses contact with his legs and parts of his limbs. The accident changed Lenny. Not only does he drag his right foot when he walks but he has also gotten lighter. As he was lying there, among fence pickets and the shards from his front light, his face on the ground between the splinters, looking at his bloody hand, how drops were taking shape upon it and seeping into the ground, how everything became a single blackness, when he was waiting for someone or something to free him from this immobility, something took root within him &ndash; a plant that grew larger and stronger with each minute of silence. The power of a full bathtub. He reads all his father&rsquo;s books and listens to all the records available at the record store. Joseph often visits him in hospital, but Lenny doesn&rsquo;t care. One day even Miranda and Nataly drop by.</p>

        <p>&ndash;How are you?</p>
        <p>&ndash;I know that you&rsquo;re a couple.</p>
        <p>&ndash;We know that you love Joseph.</p>

        <p>With threats flying at them, they leave the room at once. Lenny has a Gibson SG delivered to his hospital room, along with several amplifiers and fuzzboxes. He records an experimental, expansive, loud and sometimes extremely distorted guitar album called <i>Doom Town Boys</i> onto Joseph&rsquo;s answering machine. In comparison with the music that will emerge in the future, these compositions are altogether ordinary, but at this time they are game-changing, or rather, they would have been if Joseph&rsquo;s father hadn&rsquo;t immediately deleted that crap to free up some space on the tape.</p>
        <p>The principal of the High &amp; Low High School runs into Meggy in the hallway. Meggy is on her own, with twitching eyelids.</p>
        <p>&ndash;What are you doing out in the hallway?</p>
        <p>Meggy collapses under her own weight.</p>
        <p>&ndash;What&rsquo;s the matter?</p>
        <p>Meggy pushes her arms onto the linoleum floor, trying to hold the weight of her body.</p>
        <p>&ndash;Meggy?</p>
        <p>She vomits.</p>
        <p>&ndash;What&rsquo;s up with you?</p>
        <p>She shivers from the cold.</p>
        <p>&ndash;A doctor, quick!</p>
        <p>She gazes at the principal. She whispers.</p>
        <p>&ndash;The newspapers are bad. They&rsquo;re as bad as can be. I can&rsquo;t stand it anymore. It&rsquo;s too much. No one can stand it. These germs, this disease that calls itself journalism.</p>
        <p>&ndash;Oh? Then join the school paper and make it better.</p>
        <p>With her remaining strength, Meggy punches the principal in the face.</p>
        <p>&ndash;Gosh, you&rsquo;re so angry. I&rsquo;d like to give you a hug.</p>
        <p>&ndash;Never!</p>
        <p>She rolls away, sobs into the distance, having only just managed to escape a hug, and when she stops, alone in the field, nothing around her but the smell of buildingless air, Meggy spreads out her arms and waits for the wind to push itself under her body. A kite. She flutters. Nataly pulls her back down with the kite string.</p>
        <p>&ndash;I heard that you hit the principal?</p>
        <p>&ndash;Yeah.</p>
        <p>&ndash;Why?</p>
        <p>&ndash;She defiled me.</p>
        <p>&ndash;Oh.</p>
        <p>&ndash;And nobody is allowed to do that.</p>
        <p>&ndash;Why did you want to meet me?</p>
        <p>&ndash;I&rsquo;m very alone, Nataly.</p>
        <p>&ndash;That&rsquo;s why you wanted to see me?</p>
        <p>&ndash;I&rsquo;m afraid for you and Miranda. That couple from the hut: they weren&rsquo;t murderers, not Benjamin&rsquo;s.</p>
        <p>&ndash;Benjamin?</p>
        <p>&ndash;You&rsquo;re my only friend and I don&rsquo;t want anything to happen to you.</p>
        <p>Nataly has to stop herself from laughing, she bends down, pretends to tie her shoelace, but cuts the line that keeps Meggy attached to the earth. She flies away, gets caught in a row of poplars that jut out in front of the horizon like long-range missiles.</p>

        <p>Back home, Nataly&rsquo;s sister Emily asks Nataly if she can have her vanilla pudding. Nataly agrees, although it&rsquo;s her favorite dessert.</p>
