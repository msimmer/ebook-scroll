            <p>Use the scroll bar on the right-hand side of the page, or move your finger up and down on the screen, to flip forwards or backwards in the text.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>We hope you enjoy reading <a target="_blank" href="http://fiktion.cc/books">our books</a> in this way.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>Here are some reasons why.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>Film and music have always required a playback device, whereas the data stored in a printed book is decoded directly by the human eye. Digitization thus not only offers literature new forms of data storage and distribution but also makes it possible to present texts in a completely new way.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>The e-book formats that are popular among publishers and online stores are largely limited to mimicry of the traditional book: You read each page from top to bottom, you advance one page at a time and can highlight text segments of particular interest. A few additional features exist, such as full-text search capability, external links or social reading, but they make a basic problem even worse, one that particularly applies to reading longer literary texts today: How can it be made not only possible but also desirable to immerse oneself willingly in such texts for hours at a stretch, given the almost infinite range of media that is available on tap?</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>Recent innovations such as <span style="color:red">RVSP</span> (rapid serial visual representation) and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spritzinc.com">Spritz</a>, which hammer text into the reader’s head word by word, promise to increase reading speed. But fully understanding a text requires jumping to and fro within a phrase or across whole sentences. The yardstick for the success of a reading device for literature cannot be whether it allows you to cram ever more information into your head in ever less time while guaranteeing you won’t forget it within a day. What matters, by contrast, is the degree of immersion, which means not just getting the gist of a text, but an imaginative and intellectual engagement with it. It could be that the more thorough this immersion is, the less you remember the content later, since – as when under hypnosis or high – you are so deeply absorbed in the moment. Reading literary texts is thus qualitatively different from reading non-fiction, and digitization presents an opportunity to design an e-reader tailored to literature’s specific characteristics.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>The research finding that a line length of 55 characters is ideal was incorporated into the early stages of the design of our e-reader. But what about the optimal number of lines? The length of a printed book depends on a different set of factors, including ease of use and handling, visual appeal and a convenient frequency of page turns. It’s all too easy to lose track of where you are on the page in traditional books, however.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>Our e-reader experimentally limits the page length to ten lines, and there is no need to flip to the next page since the text automatically scrolls upwards, as with a teleprompter. The speed of the scrolling can be adjusted at will.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>In the near future, technology will enable e-readers to adjust text speed automatically relative to eye motion. For now, the resolution of cameras in computers, tablet computers and smartphones is not yet high enough. Smart Scroll – a technology developed by Samsung, which scrolls or pauses the text depending on whether you are looking at the screen or not – is still prone to errors. Our e-reader is thus a work in progress, open to further development through technological innovations, feedback and criticism. The Institute for Book Studies at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz is planning to collect and evaluate data about the way the e-reader is used; the results of their research will be presented here. We would also appreciate it if you too could let us know about your experience of our e-reader.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>For budgetary reasons the reader is currently available only online, and following legal advice we have restricted the reading material on offer to <a href="http://fiktion.cc/books/">books published by us</a>. We will gladly provide the source code upon request, however, to allow others to use and further develop our e-reader. Fiktion is an experimental project and all imitations and improvements are welcome.</p>
