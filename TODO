fiktion reader:
- mobile:
    - pinch out: font increment
    - pinch in: font decrement
    - 2 fingers drag up: speed increment
    - 2 fingers drag down: speed decrement
    - pause when a reader holds a finger on the screen

- allow for multiple books


bugs:

- mobile styles are sometimes applied to the reader in desktop mode (this was the issue at the launch of the reader where the controls disappeared)
- the text jitters when you scroll it manually
- text sometimes overlaps the controls on small screens
- the reading frame is sometimes not vertically centred on mobile phones in landscape
